# HP800G4MiniOpenCore

# This is the EFI for my HP 800 G4 Mini Hackintosh. 
# It has an i5 8600 processor and 3 display ports. For wifi/bluetooth I use an original Apple card which works just fine.
# Everything seems to work fine except for multiple monitors. I can only use one monitor but I can plug it into any of the display ports.
# Any comments, suggestions or help are highly welcome!
